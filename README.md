ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CloXD
I'm a Bioinformatician, full stack software developer interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
You can find some of my works here:
- [iMOKA](https://github.com/RitchieLabIGH/iMOKA): a tool to identify k-mers as classifing features from large datasets of sequencing data. The software is mainly written in C++ ( MLPack as ML library ) and Pyhton ( scikit-learn and TF libraries ) for the core part and Angular + Electron for the GUI.
- [IRFinder-S](https://github.com/RitchieLabIGH/IRFinder): a new version of the popular software for the identification and quantification of intron retention events. Includes a CNN based filter that discerns artefactual IR events using visual-like features ( TensorFlow Python library) and a IR database/visualization web tool, [IRbase](https://irbase.igh.cnrs.fr/)
- [Cell2Patients](https://github.com/LucoLab/Villemin_2020): I contributed to my colleague's PhD project that aim to transfer the knowledge aquired from cell lines model to patient data
- [PickPocket](https://github.com/benjaminviart/PickPocket): an attempt to create an automatic protein pocket classifier that uses secondary structure informations alongside with other useful features. Unfortunately, our tests didn't show a real improvement respect to other existing methods, but it was a good attempt.
